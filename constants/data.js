      `I am a former Civil Design Engineer transitioning to a career in web development and programming. I am currently enrolled in the full time, full stack, C# and React Epicodus coding bootcamp.`,
      `At Epicodus, I am learning to build web applications using JavaScript, React, C#/.NET, HTML, CSS, and more. Most importantly, I am learning how to think like a programmer and write clean and scalable code. My previous experience as a civil engineer and student at the University of Washington has helped me tackle complex coding problems by breaking them down to simple steps of logic. My design and permitting experience has also helped me when navigating external resources to find pertinent and accurate information for projects.`,
      `Outside of work and the classroom, I am an avid pacific northwest sports fan as well as a video game enthusiast. When I am not coding, I enjoy traveling, barhopping with friends, lifting weights, attending UW football and Mariners games, and hopping on Discord to relax and play co-op games on weekends.`
